# OPEN SOURCE VERY BIG STICK PROJECT 2024
A very large joystick gimbal for very big sticks!

This totally open source gimbal is designed for end users to either connect existing Thrustmaster compatible grips or attach any custom grip directly to the base. It supports very high spring forces allowing for very realistic feeling flight controls.

It is recommended all parts are printed in PETG, while PLA+ may be acceptable for all parts other than the CAMS, which can be ordered from 3D printed providers in very durable materials.

Checkout the PDF file in the repo to see the bill of materials and the print orientation guide. 

## The current version is Beta 1.3

Check out this build guide below to learn how to assemble the base gimbal!

You can also order the breakout PCB directly from PCBWAY, as well as the CAMs to print in Glass fibre Nylon for extra durability and higher quality than what can be done on most home printers.

## Partner Projects

### TheSimNet

Please Checkout TheSimNet's Youtube Channel. He releases designs of fully 3D printable flight grips with TM compatbility. All the renders of the OS-VBS-MK2 use his Free B-8 Grip models for reference. He also sells really cool projects like a very accurate F-15C grip.

### Freejoy

Freejoy is an excellent open source alternative to MMjoy2 and is great for creating for really low cost and powerful USB game controller devices.... if you can still find genuine STM32 boards.
